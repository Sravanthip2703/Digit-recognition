Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN with Data Augmentation
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained with data augmentation and can predict handwritten digits captured via a webcam. This project is built using TensorFlow and Keras in Python and is designed to run on Google Colab.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to:
Build and train a CNN to recognize handwritten digits.
Use data augmentation to improve model generalization.
Capture handwritten digits using a webcam.
Preprocess and predict the digit from the captured image.
Visualize the training process and evaluate the model's performance.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Google Colab (for GPU access)
TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other dependencies
Install the required packages
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python tensorflow seaborn
Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of the following layers:

Conv2D: 32 filters with a kernel size of (3,3), followed by ReLU activation.
MaxPooling2D: Pool size of (2,2) to downsample the feature maps.
Conv2D: 64 filters with a kernel size of (3,3), followed by ReLU activation.
MaxPooling2D: Pool size of (2,2).
Flatten: Flatten the 2D output to 1D.
Dense: Fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
Dropout: Dropout layer to reduce overfitting.
Dense: Output layer with 10 neurons (for digits 0-9) and softmax activation.
Data Augmentation
To improve model generalization, data augmentation is applied to the training set. The augmentation includes:

Random rotations of up to 10 degrees.
Zooming images by up to 10%.
Shifting images horizontally and vertically by up to 10%.
Applying shear transformations.
Training the Model
The model is trained using the following parameters:

Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Metrics: Accuracy
Epochs: 50 (or fewer, as required)
Batch size: 32

history = model.fit(datagen.flow(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32),
                    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
                    epochs=50,
                    callbacks=[early_stopping, reduce_lr, checkpoint])


Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Loss and Accuracy plots
The following Python libraries are used for plotting:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

Webcam Integration
Using Google Colab's integration, a webcam is accessed to capture handwritten digits. The image is then preprocessed (grayscale conversion, resizing, blurring, thresholding) and fed to the model for prediction.
from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow

filename = take_photo()  # Capture the image using webcam
processed_image = preprocess_image(filename)  # Preprocess the captured image
prediction = model.predict(processed_image)  # Predict the digit
